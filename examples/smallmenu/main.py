# This example illustrates the use of action
# containers to create new menus

from PythonExtension import QtCreator
from actions import hello, goodbye

# By convention, the menuId starts with "Python"
menuId = "Python.SmallMenu.Menu"

menu = QtCreator.Core.ActionManager.createMenu(menuId)
menu.menu().setTitle("Small menu")
menu.menu().addAction("Say hello", hello)
menu.menu().addAction("Say goodbye", goodbye)

# Add our new menu to the "Tools" menu in QtCreator
QtCreator.Core.ActionManager.actionContainer("QtCreator.Menu.Tools").addMenu(menu)
